# Pong

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

GUI Pong game in Zig, using SDL2

## Quick Start

### Building From Source

Compiling on Linux or Mac should work just fine.

If you're on Windows... either run the binary or be the first to test compiling this on Windows

Requirements:

- Zig v0.11.0
- SDL2 and SDL2_ttf

```console
$ zig build run
```

> I haven't got an M1 or M2 mac to test on, but I assume it should work fine

### Binary Download

I have a release available with a windows binary

Linux users, feel free to try to run this with WINE

## How To Play

It's pong. Simple enough really.

Hit Spacebar to start, use the arrow keys to control your paddle (the purple one)
